## Integration testing

This role provides integration tests using the Ruby RSpec/serverspec framework
with a few drawbacks at the time of writing this documentation.

Running integration tests requires a number of dependencies being
installed. As this role uses Ruby RSpec there is the need to have
Ruby with rake and bundler available.

```shell
# install role specific dependencies with bundler
bundle install
```

<!-- -->

```shell
rake suite
```
